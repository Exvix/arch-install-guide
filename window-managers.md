## What is a window manager?

Put simply, a window manager organises you windows and decides how GUI elements are placed.\
There are two main types of Window Managers (WMs):
- Stacking Window Managers (SWMs)
- Tiling Window Managers (TWMs)

An SWM is your vanilla window manager. You use your mouse to stack, arrange and rearrange windows. There's normally a system tray, and a button to minimise all apps to it.

A TWM is a bit more advanced tham an SWM. Their main focus is to increase productivity by keeping your hands on the keyboard.\
â†’ There's keybinds for all functions, however, they have a much steeper learning curve.

## My advice?

Use a stacking window manager if you use the Nano text editor, and use a tiling window manager if you use Vim, Neovim or Emacs.
